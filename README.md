# 📝 Employee Details Form - DOM Manipulation

This project demonstrates how to **build a complete HTML form entirely with JavaScript DOM manipulation**.  
No HTML form elements were written directly in the HTML file — every field, label, and button was dynamically generated using JavaScript and appended to the DOM.
